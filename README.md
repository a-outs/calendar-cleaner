# The Canvas Calendar Cleaner


Canvas offers little to no customizability when exporting calendars. 
When you try to export your calendar from Canvas to other calendar apps 
such as Google Calendar, it ends up clogged and bloated. The Canvas 
Calendar Cleaner is here to solve that by allowing you to blacklist key 
words, remove non-assignment events entirely, and much more!
